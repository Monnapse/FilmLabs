# FilmLabs
 
Local hosted streaming site.

This repository does not store any film files it uses streaming apis to stream movies/tv shows.

You can create accounts to store watch history, you can search for movies, tv shows and anime.

The database is stored using json files so you dont need to download any other software. This site should work almost out of the box which its meant for.
